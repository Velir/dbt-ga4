# The following variables should be set in the project that loads this package. 
#vars:
#    include_intraday_events: false # true|false indicates whether intraday events should be unioned into the event model
#    project: "your_project"
#    dataset: "your_dataset"
#    start_date: "20210120" # Defines the earliest GA4 _TABLE_SUFFIX to load into base events model. This is a reasonable default for the GA4 obfuscated dataset

# Query parameter exclusions
# You can remove specific query parameters from the page_location by listing them here
#    query_parameter_exclusions: ["gclid","fbclid","_ga"]

# User Properties
# User-scoped event properties can be assigned using the following variable configuration in your dbt_project.yml
# The dim_ga4__users dimension table will be updated to include the last value seen for each user
#      user_properties:
#        - event_parameter: "page_location"
#          user_property_name: "most_recent_page_location"  
#          value_type: "string_value"
#        - event_parameter: "another_event_param"
#          user_property_name: "most_recent_param"  
#          value_type: "string_value"

# Custom parameters
# custom parameters are registered by creating a var matching the event name where the custom parameter occurs
# and providing the name, matching the parameters name
# and matching the value_type to the type of column in BigQuery (string_value, int_value, float_value, double_value)
# the below example shows a page_view enhanced with the clean_event event parameter from the ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce project
#    page_view:
#      - name: "clean_event"
#        value_type: "string_value"  

# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/ directory
# as tables. These settings can be overridden in the individual model files
# using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.
