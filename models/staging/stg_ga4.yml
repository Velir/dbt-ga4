models:  
  - name: base_ga4__events
    description: Base events model that pulls all fields from raw data. Resulting table is partitioned on event_date and is useful in that BQ queries can be cached against this table, but not against wildcard searches from the original tables which are sharded on date. Some light transformation and renaming beyond the base events model. Adds surrogate keys for sessions and events
    columns:
      - name: event_date_dt
        description: Date of the event. Time zone is set to the time zone configured in the GA4 property. 
      - name: event_timestamp
        description: Timestamp indicating when the event's batch was received (as opposed to when the event actually occurred).  Time zone is set to the time zone configured in the GA4 property. 
  - name: base_ga4__events_intraday
    description: Base model for intraday events that will be unioned to the past events stored in the incremental model. 
  - name: stg_ga4__event_to_query_string_params
    description: This model pivots the query string parameters contained within the event's page_location field to become rows. Each row is a single parameter/value combination contained in a single event's query string.
  - name: stg_ga4__event_page_view

    description: Staging model containing only 'scroll' events. Includes the 'percent_scrolled' parameter.
  - name: stg_ga4__derived_user_properties
    description: Optional model that will pull out the most recent instance of a particular event parameter for each device (user_pseudo_id). Later used in the dim_ga4__user_pseudo_id dimension table.

        tests:
          - unique  
  - name: stg_ga4__derived_session_properties

        tests:
          - unique  
  - name: stg_ga4__session_conversions_daily
