            return whether this user is eligible for ads personalization; users where isAdsPersonalizationAllowed returns '(not set)' may or may not be 
            eligible for personalized ads. For personalized ads, you should treat users where isAdsPersonalizationAllowed = '(not set)' as isAdsPersonalizationAllowed = 'false' 
            because, in the most general case, some of the '(not set)' rows will include users that are not eligible for ads personalization. Users where 
            isAdsPersonalizationAllowed = 'false' may still be used for non-advertising use cases like A/B testing & data explorations. Flattened version of
