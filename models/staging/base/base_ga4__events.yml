  - name: base_ga4__events
    description: >
      Base events model that pulls all fields from raw data. Resulting table is partitioned on event_date_dt which 
      is useful in that BQ queries can be cached against this table, but not against wildcard searches from the original sharded tables. 
      This model handles some light transformation and renaming beyond the base events model. 
      Events are deduped by looking for duplicate event and event parameter payloads.

    columns:
      - name: event_date_dt
        description: Date of the event converted to Date type. Time zone is the time zone configured in the GA4 property. 
      - name: event_timestamp
        description: >
          Timestamp (in microseconds) indicating when the event's batch was received (as opposed to when the event actually occurred).  
          Time zone is technically UTC, but in a practical sense it is set to the time zone configured in the GA4 property.

        description: >
