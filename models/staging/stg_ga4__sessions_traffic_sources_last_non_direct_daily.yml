      This model associates the last non-direct traffic acquisition data with the current session. 
      It does this by scanning backwards 30 days from the session date (aka. the lookback window) and looks for the recent non-direct traffic source. 
      This model is incremental, partitioned on session_partition_date, and unique on session_partition_key.
    columns:
      - name: session_partition_key

          - unique
