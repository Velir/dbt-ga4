    description: >
        Staging model for the base_ga4__users table which pulls data from the user export.
        This model is keyed on user_id field. Unlike most keys in the package, this key is not hashed.
        This model unnests user properties and audience using variables of the same name that match the user property 
        or audience name and prefixing the unnested fields with those names.
