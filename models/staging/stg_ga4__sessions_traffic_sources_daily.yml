    description: >
      Incremental model that finds the acquisition source of each session day partition. 
      Uses the first non-null source value as the basis for selecting the event that will be used to assign source, medium, campaign, content, and term values. 
      The session_start and first_visit events are ignored for this purpose as they contain no acquisition data. 
      Aggregated by session_partition_key.
