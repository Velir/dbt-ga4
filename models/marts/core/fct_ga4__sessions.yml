    description: >
      Fact table containing metrics related to sessions. This model uses the daily partition metrics generated in fct_ga4__sessions_daily to calculate metrics for the session as a whole. Unique on session_key.
    columns:
      - name: session_key
        description: >
          Unique key assigned to sessions. Sessions can span multiple dates/partitions.

          - unique
      - name: user_id
        description: >
          User ID associated with the client. Will be set to null unless explicitly assigned in the GA4 implementation. This value can change mid-session so we take the 'max' value.

          Date associated with the first session partition.
