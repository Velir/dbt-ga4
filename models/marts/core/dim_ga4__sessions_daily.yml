  - name: dim_ga4__sessions_daily
    description: >
      Incremental, partitioned dimension table for session partitions. Partitioned on session_partition_date for improved query optimization when filtering on date. 
      Contains context useful for filtering sessions such as acquisition source, medium, and campaign. 
      Each row represents a daily session partition (as opposed to a session). 
      Unique on session_partion_key
    columns:
      - name: session_partition_key
        description: >
          Unique key assigned to session partitions which are daily partitions of a session. In GA4, sessions can span multiple days. 
          To improve query performance, it's easier to work with 'session partitions' which can be filtered/partitioned by date.
        tests:
          - unique
      - name: session_key
        description: >
          Unique key assigned to sessions. Sessions can span multiple dates/partitions. 
      - name: session_partition_date
        description: >
          Date associated with the session_partition_key. Used to partition the table. Filter on this column to optimize query cost and performance. 
      - name: session_source
        description: The source of the session based on the events contained within this particular session. For last non-direct source, see last_non_direct_source
      - name: last_non_direct_source
        description: The last non-direct source attributed to this session based on a 30-day lookback window.
