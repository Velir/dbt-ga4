models:
  - name: dim_ga4__sessions
    description: Dimension table for sessions containing context useful for filtering such as acquisition source, medium, and campaign. Each row represents a session. Unique on session_key
    columns:
      - name: session_key
        tests:
          - unique
  - name: dim_ga4__client_keys
    description: Dimension table for user devices (client_key) which includes data from the first and last event produced. Unique on client_key
    columns:
      - name: client_key
        description: Hashed combination of user_pseudo_id and stream_id
        tests:
          - unique
  - name: fct_ga4__pages
    description: Incremental model with page metrics such as visits, users, new_users, entrances and exits as well as configurable conversion counts. Each row is grouped by page_location, event_date_dt, and hour.
    columns:
      - name: total_engagement_time_msec
        description: The total engagement time for that page_location.
      - name: avg_engagement_time_denominator
        description: Use avg_engagement_time_denominator to calculate the average engagement time, which is derived by dividing the sum of total engagement time by the product of the sum of the denominator and 1000 to get the average engagement time in seconds (average_engagement_time = sum(total_engagement_time_msec)/(sum(avg_engagement_time_denominator) *1000 )). The denominator excludes page_view events where no engagement time is recorded for the page_location within a session. However, it includes subsequent page_view events to a page_location that has previously recorded a page_view event in the same session, even if the subsequent event has no recorded engagement time.
  - name: fct_ga4__client_keys
    description: Fact table with aggregate metrics at the level of the user's device (as indicated by the client_key). Metrics are aggregated from fct_ga4__sessions.
    columns:
      - name: client_key
        description: Hashed combination of user_pseudo_id and stream_id
        tests: 
          - unique
  - name: fct_ga4__user_ids
    description: Fact table with aggregate metrics at the level of the user_id when one is present, otherwise at the device level (as indicated by the client_key). Metrics are aggregated from fct_ga4__client_keys.
    columns:
      - name: user_id_or_client_key
