      - name: user_pseudo_id
        tests:
          - unique
  - name: fct_ga4__sessions
    description: Fact table containing session metrics. 1 row per session. Sessions can span multiple days, so it isn't possible to partition this table by day.

      - name: session_key
        tests:
          - unique
  - name: fct_ga4__sessions_daily

          - unique
  - name: fct_ga4__pages
